INTRODUCTION

Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this case study, I work for a fictional company, Cyclistic, along with some key team members. In order to answer the business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. Along the way, the Case Study Roadmap tables — including guiding questions and key tasks — will help me stay on the right path.

My objective is to discern usage patterns between casual riders and annual members. Using these insights, my team aims to craft a targeted marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. However, before implementation, my recommendations require approval from Cyclistic executives, supported by compelling data insights and professional visualizations.
